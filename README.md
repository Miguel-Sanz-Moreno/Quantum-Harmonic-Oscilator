# Quantum-Harmonic-Oscilator

A university academic project focused on the numerical solution of the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator.

The system was studied by discretizing the Schrödinger equation using the Finite Difference Method, constructing the kinetic energy operator as a second-derivative matrix and combining it with the harmonic potential to build the full Hamiltonian. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions were then obtained through matrix diagonalization in Python.
